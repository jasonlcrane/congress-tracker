Welcome to the Congress on Guns tracker
==========================

This app uses the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) to search for bills and statements related to guns and gun violence.

Remix it to make it better or use it as starting point for your own project. You'll need to get an API key for the ProPublica Congress API.
